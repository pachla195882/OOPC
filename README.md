# OOPC
This is repository for "Object Oriented Programming in C++" course conducted at Lodz University of Technology. All tasks that codes are written for are to be found here: http://neo.dmcs.p.lodz.pl/~wsan/oopc/index.html .

All codes are tested using Valgrind to check memory leaks. 

This repo was created for my convenience to edit code anywhere, and by the way you can find it helpful.

Use it wisely.
